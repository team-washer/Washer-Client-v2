# Git Workflow Rules

Use these rules for branch names, commits, PR text, and change grouping.

## Branch Names

Use:

```text
<type>/<kebab-case-description>
```

Recommended types:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `refactor`
- `style`
- `chore`
- `docs`
- `test`
- `ci`

Examples:

- `feat/add-machine-filter`
- `fix/reservation-form-validation`
- `chore/setup-claude-harness`

## Commit Messages

Use short Conventional Commit-style messages. Write the description in Korean:

```text
<type>: <한국어 설명>
```

Add a scope only when it improves clarity:

```text
feat(reservation): 대기 중 예약 필터 추가
```

Keep each commit focused on one logical change. Do not mix source changes, formatting churn, and harness configuration unless they are part of the same requested task.

## Pull Requests

- Follow `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Describe purpose, summarize work, link related issues, and attach screenshots or videos for UI changes.
- Mention validation commands and any checks that could not be run.
